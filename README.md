üîπ Part 1: SQL Basics (1‚Äì10)


1. What is SQL?
Answer:

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data.

3. Types of SQL Statements
   
Answer:

DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP

DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT

TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE

3. Difference Between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP

   
| Command  | Deletes Rows | Rollback Possible | Resets Identity | Deletes Structure |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| DELETE   | Yes          | Yes               | No              | No                |
| TRUNCATE | Yes (All)    | No                | Yes             | No                |
| DROP     | Yes (All)    | No                | N/A             | Yes               |

DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
DROP TABLE employees;

4. What is a Primary Key?
Answer:
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must be unique and not null.

CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

5. What is a Foreign Key?
Answer:
A foreign key links two tables together by referencing the primary key in another table.

CREATE TABLE departments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  dept_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(id)
);


6. What are Constraints in SQL?
Answer:
Constraints enforce rules on data in tables.

NOT NULL

UNIQUE

PRIMARY KEY

FOREIGN KEY

CHECK

DEFAULT

CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
);


7. Difference Between WHERE and HAVING
WHERE filters rows before aggregation.
HAVING filters after aggregation.


-- WHERE filters individual rows
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;

-- HAVING filters groups
SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY dept_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

8. Difference Between CHAR and VARCHAR
CHAR(n): Fixed length, padded with spaces.

VARCHAR(n): Variable length, up to n characters.

CREATE TABLE example (
  fixed CHAR(10),
  variable VARCHAR(10)
);


9. What is Normalization?
Answer:
Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy.

1NF: Atomic columns

2NF: Remove partial dependencies

3NF: Remove transitive dependencies



10. What is Denormalization?
Answer:
Denormalization is the process of combining tables to improve performance, at the cost of redundancy.

üîπ Part 2: SQL Queries (11‚Äì20)
11. Write a query to fetch all records from a table.
SELECT * FROM employees;

12. Write a query to fetch unique values from a column.

SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;

13. Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary.

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

‚úÖ Alternatively (PostgreSQL syntax):

SELECT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;

14. Write a query to count the number of employees in each department.

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;


15. Write a query to fetch employees whose names start with 'A'.

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';


16. Write a query to fetch employees hired in the last 30 days.

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';


17. Write a query to find NULL values in a column.

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NULL;


18. How do you update data in a table?

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department = 'Sales';


19. Write a query to delete duplicate records from a table.
‚úÖ Using CTE and ROW_NUMBER() (PostgreSQL):

WITH duplicates AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY name, email ORDER BY id) AS rn
  FROM employees
)
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM duplicates WHERE rn > 1);


20. Write a query to swap values between two columns.

UPDATE employees
SET column1 = column2,
    column2 = column1;

    
‚úÖ In PostgreSQL:
UPDATE employees
SET column1 = column2,
    column2 = column1;

    
But for atomic swap (avoid same value being overwritten), use a temp:
UPDATE employees
SET column1 = column2,
    column2 = column1;

üîπ Part 3: Joins and Relationships (21‚Äì25)

21. What are joins in SQL? Name all types.
    
Answer:
Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

Types of Joins:

INNER JOIN: Only matching rows from both tables.

LEFT JOIN: All rows from the left table and matching from right.

RIGHT JOIN: All rows from the right table and matching from left.

FULL OUTER JOIN: All rows from both tables.

CROSS JOIN: Cartesian product (all combinations).

SELF JOIN: A table joined with itself.

22. Difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN


| Feature       | INNER JOIN         | LEFT JOIN                           |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Returns       | Only matching rows | All from left + matching from right |
| Missing match | Not included       | NULLs for missing right-side rows   |


-- INNER JOIN
SELECT e.name, d.name AS dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT e.name, d.name AS dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;


23. What is a SELF JOIN?

Answer:
A self join is a regular join where a table is joined with itself.

SELECT a.name AS employee, b.name AS manager
FROM employees a
JOIN employees b ON a.manager_id = b.id;

24. What is a CROSS JOIN? Where is it used?
Answer:
A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables.

Use case: Generating combinations (e.g. pairing sizes with colors).

SELECT * FROM colors CROSS JOIN sizes;

If colors has 3 rows and sizes has 2 ‚Üí result has 6 rows.



25. Write a query to join two tables and fetch matching records.

SELECT e.name, d.name AS dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;


üîπ Part 4: Indexes and Views (26‚Äì30)

26. What is an index? What types are there?
Answer:
An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval.

Types of indexes:

B-tree index (default in PostgreSQL)

Hash index

Unique index

Composite index

Partial index

GIN/GiST indexes (used for full-text search, arrays)

-- Creating a basic index
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);

-- Creating a unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON employees(email);

27. How does indexing improve query performance?
Answer:
Indexes allow the database to locate data without scanning the entire table. Think of it like a book‚Äôs index ‚Äì it helps you find information quickly.

Without index:

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE email = 'abc@example.com';
‚Üí Full table scan
With index on email ‚Üí O(log n) search time


28. What is a view in SQL? How is it different from a table?

Answer:
A view is a virtual table based on a SQL query. It does not store data itself, only the query definition.


CREATE VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT department, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
‚úîÔ∏è Views are useful for:

Abstraction

Reuse of complex queries

Security (limiting column access)


29. Can you update a view in SQL?
Answer:

Yes, but only if:

The view is based on a single table

It doesn‚Äôt use aggregate functions or GROUP BY

No joins, subqueries, or DISTINCT

‚úÖ Example:


CREATE VIEW emp_view AS
SELECT id, name FROM employees;

-- Updatable
UPDATE emp_view SET name = 'John' WHERE id = 2;

30. What are materialized views?
Answer:
A materialized view stores the query result physically, unlike normal views which are just saved queries. They can be refreshed manually or automatically.


CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_cache AS
SELECT department, SUM(sales)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

To refresh it:
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_cache;


üîπ Part 5: Advanced SQL Concepts (31‚Äì35)
31. What are subqueries? Explain with an example.
Answer:
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query. It can be used in SELECT, WHERE, or FROM.


-- Example: Get employees earning more than the average salary

SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);


32. What is a correlated subquery?
Answer:
A correlated subquery uses values from the outer query. It runs once for each row of the outer query.


-- Example: Find employees with the highest salary in their department
SELECT e1.name, e1.salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT MAX(e2.salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e1.department = e2.department
);


33. What are window functions in SQL?
Answer:
Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without collapsing rows like GROUP BY.


SELECT name, department, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank
FROM employees;

üìå Common window functions:

RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()

SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() OVER (...)

LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE()



34. What is RANK() vs DENSE_RANK()?



| Function       | Gap in Ranks | Example (3rd rank skipped) |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| `RANK()`       | Yes          | 1, 2, 2, 4                 |
| `DENSE_RANK()` | No           | 1, 2, 2, 3                 |


SELECT name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;


35. What are GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses?
GROUP BY: Groups rows with the same values.
ORDER BY: Sorts the result set.

-- Group by department and count employees

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS emp_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- Sort by salary descending

SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;


üîπ Part 6: Transactions and Locks (36‚Äì40)

36. What is a transaction? What are its ACID properties?
Answer:

A transaction is a group of SQL operations executed as a single unit. It must follow ACID properties:

A ‚Äì Atomicity: All operations succeed or none do.

C ‚Äì Consistency: Keeps database in a valid state.

I ‚Äì Isolation: Transactions don‚Äôt interfere with each other.

D ‚Äì Durability: Once committed, changes are permanent.


BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;


37. Difference between COMMIT and ROLLBACK

    

| Operation  | Meaning                                    | Effect                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `COMMIT`   | Saves all changes made in the transaction  | Changes are permanent  |
| `ROLLBACK` | Undoes all changes made in the transaction | Reverts to last COMMIT |


BEGIN;

DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 101;

-- Undo the deletion
ROLLBACK;


38. What is a SAVEPOINT in SQL?
Answer:
SAVEPOINT allows partial rollbacks within a transaction.


BEGIN;

UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1;
SAVEPOINT before_bonus;

UPDATE employees SET bonus = 1000;

-- Oops, mistake! Roll back only bonus update
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_bonus;

COMMIT;


39. What are locks in databases?
Answer:
Locks are mechanisms to prevent concurrent users from modifying the same data at the same time.

Types:
Shared Lock (Read lock): Multiple reads allowed.
Exclusive Lock (Write lock): Only one writer, no other reads/writes.

Used automatically by the DB engine during transactions.



40. Difference between Pessimistic and Optimistic Locking

    
| Lock Type           | Behavior                                       | Use Case                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Pessimistic Locking | Locks data before accessing                    | High-conflict environments |
| Optimistic Locking  | Allows access but checks for conflicts at save | Low-conflict scenarios     |


üî∏ Pessimistic:


SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;


üî∏ Optimistic (via version column):
UPDATE products
SET price = 100, version = version + 1
WHERE id = 1 AND version = 2;


üîπ Part 7: Stored Procedures, Triggers, and Functions (41‚Äì44)


41. What is a stored procedure?
Answer:
A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed with a single call.

‚úÖ Benefits:

Improves performance (compiled once)

Encourages reuse

Helps with security and abstraction


-- PostgreSQL stored procedure


CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE give_bonus(emp_id INT, bonus_amount NUMERIC)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE employees SET bonus = bonus + bonus_amount
  WHERE id = emp_id;
END;
$$;

-- Call it
CALL give_bonus(101, 500);


42. Difference between stored procedures and functions

    
    
| Feature           | Stored Procedure             | Function                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Returns a value?  | No (optional OUT parameters) | Yes (must return a value)   |
| Called with       | `CALL`                       | `SELECT function_name(...)` |
| Used in queries?  | No                           | Yes                         |
| Can use `RETURN`? | Only for exiting procedure   | Yes (to return result)      |


‚úÖ Example function:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_salary(emp_id INT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Use:
SELECT get_salary(101);



43. What is a trigger in SQL?
Answer:
A trigger automatically performs an action in response to an event on a table (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

‚úÖ Example use cases:

    Auditing
  
    Enforcing business rules

    Auto-updating fields


44. When would you use a trigger?
Answer:
Triggers are used when you need automatic and consistent enforcement of rules or actions, such as:

   Automatically updating a timestamp column

   Logging changes to a table

   Restricting certain operations


-- Example: Update `updated_at` on row change

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_modified_time()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_time_trigger
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_modified_time();



üîπ Part 8: Data Types and Functions (45‚Äì48)


45. What are common SQL data types?
Answer:
Here are commonly used PostgreSQL data types:



| Category   | Data Types                                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Numeric    | `INT`, `BIGINT`, `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`, `FLOAT`, `SERIAL` |
| Character  | `CHAR(n)`, `VARCHAR(n)`, `TEXT`                          |
| Date/Time  | `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `INTERVAL`                  |
| Boolean    | `BOOLEAN` (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)                             |
| Binary     | `BYTEA`                                                  |
| JSON/Array | `JSON`, `JSONB`, `ARRAY`                                 |

CREATE TABLE sample (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  price NUMERIC(10, 2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  active BOOLEAN
);


46. Difference between NOW(), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, and SYSDATE()



| Function            | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `NOW()`             | Returns current timestamp          |
| `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` | ANSI standard, same as `NOW()`     |
| `SYSDATE()` (MySQL) | Returns time of function execution |

‚úÖ PostgreSQL:


SELECT NOW();                 -- 2025-07-13 21:10:45
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;     -- 2025-07-13 21:10:45

‚úÖ MySQL:

SELECT SYSDATE();             -- Slightly different behavior: time of execution



47. What is the use of COALESCE()?
Answer:
COALESCE() returns the first non-null value in the argument list. It's useful for handling NULLs.

SELECT name, COALESCE(bonus, 0) AS safe_bonus
FROM employees;


‚û°Ô∏è If bonus is NULL, it returns 0.

48. Difference between ISNULL() and NULLIF()


| Function       | Use Case                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `ISNULL(x)`    | (In SQL Server) returns 1 if x is NULL |
| `NULLIF(x, y)` | Returns NULL if x = y; else x          |


‚úÖ PostgreSQL example:


-- NULLIF: Prevent division by zero

SELECT salary / NULLIF(bonus, 0) FROM employees;


‚û°Ô∏è If bonus = 0, NULLIF makes it NULL and avoids divide-by-zero error.

‚úÖ Shall I continue with Part 9: Performance & Best Practices (Questions 49‚Äì50)?



üîπ Part 9: Performance & Best Practices (49‚Äì50)


49. How can you optimize a slow SQL query?

Answer:

Here are key techniques to improve SQL performance:

‚úÖ Use Indexes Wisely

    Create indexes on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY.

‚úÖ **Avoid SELECT ***

    Fetch only the required columns.


  SELECT name, salary FROM employees;  -- ‚úÖ Good
  SELECT * FROM employees;             -- ‚ùå Bad


‚úÖ Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to Debug

In PostgreSQL:


   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

‚úÖ Use LIMIT/OFFSET with large data


   SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10 OFFSET 100;
‚úÖ Avoid functions on indexed columns in WHERE


-- ‚ùå Slower (can't use index)
WHERE UPPER(name) = 'JOHN'

-- ‚úÖ Faster
WHERE name = 'John'


‚úÖ Avoid correlated subqueries when possible


50. What are common reasons for poor SQL performance?
Answer:
Common causes include:

     Missing Indexes
    
    *Poor query structure (e.g., using SELECT )
    
    Too many joins or subqueries
    
    Not analyzing/explaining query plans
    
    Stale statistics or bloated tables
    
    Large datasets without pagination
    
    Using OR instead of UNION ALL (in some cases)

‚úÖ Example bad query:
      SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped' OR status = 'delivered';
      
‚úÖ Optimized alternative:
      SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status IN ('shipped', 'delivered');
